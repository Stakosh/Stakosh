## Hi there 👋

I'm **Javiera Soto**, currently studying Ingeniería Civil Informática.


🧠 I'm self-learning through:
- [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com)
- [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/)
- [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/)  
These resources help me strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts as I approach my final year.

💻 I'm passionate about building web applications and expanding my technical toolkit.

📚 Some of the projects I've worked on:

- 🧩 **Entrega2**  
  A full-stack web platform similar to Webcursos, designed for students, professors, and administrators.  
  Built with:
  - 🐍 Flask (Python)  
  - 🐘 PostgreSQL  
  - ⚛️ React JS  
  - 🐳 Docker & Docker Compose

- ⚙️ **xv6-riscv**  
  A forked repository used for the Operating Systems course. We explored how operating systems work at a low level using xv6 on RISC-V architecture.

- 🛠️ **PROYECTO**  
  Final group project for the Software Design course. We worked collaboratively using **JavaScript** and **CSS** to build a functional web solution.

🔐 I'm currently looking for help and guidance to learn more about **cybersecurity** – feel free to share resources or advice!

🎮 Fun fact: I'm a big fan of the **Half-Life** 🦯 λ
