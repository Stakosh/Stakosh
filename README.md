## Hi there 👋

I'm **Javiera Soto**, currently studying Ingeniería Civil Informática.

🧠 I'm self-learning through [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) and [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/) to strengthen my understanding of core computer science concepts as I approach my final year.

💻 I'm passionate about building web applications and expanding my technical toolkit.

🔐 I'm currently looking for help and guidance to learn more about **cybersecurity** – feel free to share resources or advice!

🎮 Fun fact: I'm a big fan of the **Half-Life** 🦯
